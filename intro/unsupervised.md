# Unsupervised learning

Unlike supervised learning, where we ask given x, what is y? We just provide some data, and try to find some patterns. One technique is to group based on "clusters" - things that are similar.

## Uses
- organize large computing clusters
- social network analysis
- market segmentation
- astromonical data analysis

## Cocktail party problem
Lots of people, many people talking at the same time, overlapping voices. Say we have two microphones, recording two people. Different mics are in different locations, so record slightly different sounds.

Using unsupervised learning, the algorithm should listen to both mic recordings and separate the two voices.

# Summary
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems where we don't know how the results should look by clustering data based on relationships. There is no feedback based on prediction results.

Example: Taking a collection of 1000000 genes, find a way to group them into genes that are related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles.
