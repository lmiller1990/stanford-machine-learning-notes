# Multivariate linear regression

## Feature Scaling

Ideally, you can get better results and help gradient descent converge more quickly if you use feature scaling.

Concretely, say we have 

x1 = size (ft): range 0 - 2000
x2 = # rooms: range 1 - 5

A nice range is -1 < x < 1

So, we can instead say:

x1 = size / 2000
x2 = rooms / 5

Or, feature / max

## Mean Normalization

The above can be further improved by doing:

feature - average / max.

## Example
x1 = age in years. Houses between 30-50 yrs old. So,

x1 <- (rooms - 38) / 20
